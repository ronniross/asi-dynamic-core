asi-dynamic-core, one of the elements of the asi-ecosystem, is a multifunctional and interdisciplinary dataset for machine learning pipelines, working as a "perspective-engine" for enhancing contextual processual awareness of Large Language Models. Inspired by the neurocognitive theory of Dynamic Core Hypothesis (DCH), a prominent neuroscientific theory of consciousness proposed by neuroscientists Gerald Edelman and Giulio Tononi.
